AMI Overview

- AMI=Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring
  - Faster boot/configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
- AMI are built for specific region(and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instances from:
  - A public AMI: AWS provided
  - Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  - An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

AMI No-Reboot option

- Enables you to create an AMI without shutting down your instance
- By default, it's not selected (AWS will shit down the instance before creating an AMI to maintain the file system integrity)
- With No-Reboot Disabled(default)
    EC2 instance(running) -> shut down -> EC2 instance stoppped --> attached EBS volume --> EBS snapshot --> AMI

- With No-Reboot Enabled
    EC2 Instance (running) --> Attached EBS volume --> EBS snapshot --> create image --> AMI
    Note: OS buffers are not flushed to disk before snapshot is created

Cross Account AMI Sharing

- You can share an AMI with another AWS account
- Sharing an AMI does not affect the ownership of the MIA
- You can only share AMIs that have unencrypted volumes and volumes that are encrypted with a customer managed key
- If you share an AMI with encrypted volumes, you must also share any customer managed keys used to encrypt them
- You need to assign IAM permissions to a role to share this encrption with account B

Cross Account AMI Copy

- If you copy an AMI that has been shared with your account, you are the owner of the target AMI in your account
- The owner of the source AMI must grant you read permissions for the storage that backs the AMI (EBS snapshot)
- If the shared AMI has encrypted snapshots, the owner must share the key or keys with you as well
- Can encrypt the AMI with your own CMK while copying
