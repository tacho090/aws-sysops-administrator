Load Balancers MOnitoring

All Load Balancer metrics are directly pushed to CloudWatch metrics

- BackendConnectionErrors
- HealthyHOstCount/UnHealthyCostCount
- HTTPCode_Backend_2XX: Succesful request
- HTTPCode_Backend_3XX: redirected request
- HTTPCode_ELB_4XX: Client Error Codes
- HTTPCOde_ELB_5XX: Server error codes generated by the load balancer
- Latency
- RequestCount
- RequestCountPerTarget
- SurgeQueueLength: THe total number of requests(HTTP listener) or connections(TCP listener) that are pending routing to a healthy instance. Help to scale out ASG. Max Value is 1024
- SpilloverCount: THe total number of requests that were rejected because the surge queue is full
- Access Logs from Load Balancers canbe stored in S3 and contain:
	- Time
	- ClientIP Address
	- Latencies
	- Request paths
	- Server response
	- TraceId
- Only pay for the S3 storage
- Helpful for compliance reason
- Helpful for keeping access data even after ELB or EC2 instances are terminated
- Access Logs are already encrypted

Application Load Balancer Request Tracing
- Request tracing - each HTTP request has an added custom header 'X-Amzn-Trace-Id'
- Example:
	X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-67891233-abcdef012345678912334567890
- This is useful in logs/distributed tracing platform to track a single request
- Application Load Balancer is not yet integrated with X-Ray
