Sticky Sessions(Session Affinity)

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
- This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers
- The "cookie" used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose his session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

Sticky Sessions - Cookie Names

- Application-based cookies
	- Custom cookies

	- Application Cookie
		- Generated by the load balancer
		- Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
- Duration-based Cookies
	- Cookie generated by the load balancer
