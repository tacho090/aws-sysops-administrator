Network Load Balancer

- Network Load Balancers(Layer 4) allow to:
	- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
	- Handle millions of requests per second
	- Less latency ~ 100 ms(vs 400 ms for ALB)

- NLB has one static IP per AZ and supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
- NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
- Not included in the AWS free tier
