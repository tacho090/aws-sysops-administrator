Auto Scaling Group

- In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
- In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group(ASG) is to:
	- Scale out(add EC2 instance) to match an increased load
	- Scale in(remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
	- Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of EC2 instances running
	- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
	- Recreate an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: unhealthy)
- ASG are free (you only pay for the underlying EC2 instances)
- Minimum Capacity
- Desired Capacity
- Maximum Capacity
