SSL/TLS Basics

- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit(in-flight encryption)
- SSL refers to Secure Socket Layer, used to encrypt connections
- TLS refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version
- Nowadays, TLS certificates are mainly used but people still refer as SSL
- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities(CA)
- Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc
- SSL certificates have an expiration date(you set) and must be renewed

Load Balancer - SSL Certificates

Users ----> HTTPS (encrypted) over www ----> Load Balancer ----> HTTP Overprivate VPC ----> EC2 instance
      <------------------------------------		   <------------------------------

- The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate(SSL/TLS server certificate)
- You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
- You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
- HTTPS listener:
	- You must specify a default certificate
	- You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
	- Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
	- Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS (legacy clients)
