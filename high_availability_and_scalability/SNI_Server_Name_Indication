SNI - Server Name Indication

- SNI solves the problem of loading mutliple SSL certificates onto one web server(to serve multiple websites)
- It's a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
- The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one

Note:
- Only works for ALB & NLB(newer generation) & cloudfront
- Does not work for CLB

					 |				 |---------> Target Group for domain1.example.com
					 | SSL Cert: domain1.example.com |
					 | SSL Cert: www.mycorp.com	 |
