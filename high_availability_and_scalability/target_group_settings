Target Group Settings

- deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds: time the load balancer waits before deregistering a target
- slow_start.duration_seconds:
	- By default, a target receives its full share of requests once it's registered with the target group
	- Slow Start Mode gives healthy targets time to warm-up before the load balancer sends them a ful share of requests
	- The load balancer linearly increases the number of requests that it sends to the target
	- A target exits Slow Start Mode when:
		- The duration period elapses
		- The target becomes unhealth
- To disable, set Slow start duration value to 0
- load_balancing.algorithm.type: how the load balancer selects targets when routing requests (Round Robin, Least Outstanding Requests)
	- Least Outstanding Requests
		- The next instance to receive the request is the instance that has the lowest number of pending/unfinished requests
		- Works with application load balancer and classic load balancer(HTTP/HTTPS)
	- Round Robin
		- Equally choose the targets from the target group
		- Works with ALB and CLB(TCP)
	- Flow Hash
		- Selects a target based on the protocol, source/destination IP address, source/destination port and TCP sequence number
		- Each TCP/UDP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection
		- Works with NLB
