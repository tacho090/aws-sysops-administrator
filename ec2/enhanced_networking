Enhanced Networking

- EC2 Enhanced Networking
    - Higher bandwidth, higher PPS(packets per second), lower latency
    - Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100 Gpbs
    - Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - LEGACY
    - Works for newer generation EC2 instances

- Elastic Fabric Adapter(EFA)
    - Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
    - Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
    - Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
    - Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low latency reliable transport
