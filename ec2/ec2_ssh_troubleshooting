EC2 ssh troubleshooting

- Make sure the private key(pem file) on your linux machine has 400 permissions, else you will get "Unprotected private key file" error
- Make sure the username for the OS is given correctly when logging via SSH, else you will get "Host key not found", "Permission denied" or "Connection closed by [instance] port 22" error
- Possible reasons for "Connection timed out" to EC2 instance via SSH
  - SG is not configured correctly
  - NACL is not configured correctly
  - Check the route table for the subnet (routes traffic destined outside VPC to IGW)
  - Instance doesn't have a public ipv4
  - CPU load of the instance is high

ssh vs EC2 Instance Connect

- Connect using SSH
Inbound Rules

| Type | Protocol | Port | Source |
|-----|----------| -----| ------- |
| SSH | TCP | 22 | 1.2.3.4/32

User with IPv4: 1.2.3.4 can access
User with IPv4: 5.6.7.8 cannot access

- Connect using EC2 Instance Connect
Inbound rules

A user with a random ip address will make use of the EC2 Instance Connect API who will push a one-time SSH public key into the EC2 instance and connect to it from this ip group we will define next.

| Type | Protocol | Port | Source |
| ---- | --------| ------| ------ |
| SSH | TCP | 22 | 18.206.107.24/29 | ---> Allows AWS IP Range 

Steps for configuring network access to an instance:

AWS IP address ranges json file reference in docs:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html

Search for the ip range in this website:
https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json

Example output found:
{
  "ip_prefix": "18.206.107.24/29"
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "service": "EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT",
  "network_border_group": "us-east-1"
}
