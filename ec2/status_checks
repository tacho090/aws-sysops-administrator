Status Checks

- Automated checks to identify hardware and software issues

- System Status Checks
  - Monitors problems with AWS systems (software/hardware issues on the physical host, loss of system power)
  - Check Personal Health Dashboard for any scheduled critical maintenance by AWS to your instance's host
  - Resolution: stop and start the instance (instance migrated to a new host)

- Instance Status Checks
  - Monitors software/network configuration of your instance(invalid network configuration, exhausted memory)
  - Resolution: reboot the instance or change instance configuration

CW Metrics & Recovery

- CloudWatch Metrics(1 minute interval)
  - StatusCheckFailed_System
  - StatusCheckFailed_Instance
  - StatusCheckFailed(for both)
- Option 1: CloudWatch Alarm
  - Recover EC2 instance with the same private/public IP, EIP, metadata and Placement Group
  - Send notifications using SNS
- Option 2: Auto Scaling Group
  - Set min/max/desired to recover an instance but won't keep the same private and elastic IP

You can create a status check alarm by clicking under Status Checks and creating an alarm

Manually set alarms for testing

1. aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name awsec2-i-04ed760382c496313-GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold-StatusCheckFailed_System --state-value ALARM --state-reason "testing recovery action"

2. Review alarm state for ec2 instance

SYSTEM status checks
System status checks monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs

Problem with the underlying host. Example: 

Loss of network connectivity

Loss of system power

Software issues on the physical host

Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability

Either wait for AWS to fix the host, OR

Move the EC2 instance to a new host = STOP & START the instance (if EBS backed)



INSTANCE status checks
Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance

Example of issues

Incorrect networking or startup configuration

Exhausted memory

Corrupted file system

Incompatible kernel

Requires your involvement to fix

Restart the EC2 instance, OR

Change the EC2 instance configuration
