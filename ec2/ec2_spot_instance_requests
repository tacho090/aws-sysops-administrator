EC2 Spot Instances & Spot Fleet

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand
- Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
  - THe hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
  - If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to stop or terminate your instance within a 2 minute grace period
- Other strategy: Spot Block
  - "block" spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
  - In rare situations, the instace may be reclaimed

- Used for batch jobs, data analysis or workloads that are resilient to failures
- Not great for critical jobs or databases

How to terminate Spot Instances?

  You can only cancel Spot instance requests that are open, active or disabled
  Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances
  You must first cancel a Spot Request and then terminate the associated Spot INstances

Spot Fleets

- Spot fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
  - Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
  - Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
  - Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances
  -  lowestPrice: from the pool with the lowest price(cost optimization, short workload)
  - diversified: distributed across all pools(great for availability , long workloads)
  - capacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
- SpotFleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price
