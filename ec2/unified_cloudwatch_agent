Unified CloudWatch Agent

- For virtual servers(EC2 instances, on premises-servers, ...)
- Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, used disk space, etc
- Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
  - No logs from inside your EC2 instance will be sent to CLoudWatch LOgs without using an agent
- Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store
- Make sure IAM permissions are correct
- Default namespace for metrics collected by the Unified CloudWatch agent is CWAgent (can be configured/changed)
- Collect metrics and monitor system utilization of individual processes
- Support both Linux and Windows servers
- Example: amount of time the process uses CPU, amount of memory the process uses, ...
- Select which processes to monitor by
  - pid_file: name of process identification number(PID) files they create
  - exe: process name that match string you specify (RegEx)
  - pattern: command lines used to start the processes (RegEx)
- Metrics collected by procstat plugin begins with "procstat" prefix (e.g. procstat_cpu_time, procstat_cpu_usage)

To initiate this agent in an EC2 instance:

- Create IAM Role CloudWatchAgent AmazonEC2RoleForCloudWatch with the following summary:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeTags",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetParameter"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/AmazonCloudWatch-*"
        }
    ]
}

- Assign this agent to an EC2 instance
- SSH into the instance
- install httpd
  - yum install httpd
  - systemctl start httpd
  - systemctl enable httpd
  - install the agent
    - wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm 
    - sudo rpm -U ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
  - runthe wizard
    - sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
  - complete all the steps and export the configuration to the ssm parameter store
  - automatically import configuration to a new ec2 instance
    - sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c ssm:AmazonCloudWatch-linux -s
