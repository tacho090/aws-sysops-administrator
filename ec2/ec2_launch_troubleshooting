EC2 Launch Troubleshooting

- #InstanceLimitExceeded: if you get this error, it means that you have reached your limit of max number of VCPUs per region

- On-Demand instance limits are set on a per-region basis

- Example: if you run on-demand (A,C,D,H,I,M,R,T,Z) instance types you'll have 64 vCPUs(default)

- Resolution: Either launch the instance in a different region or request AWS to increase your limit of the region

- NOTE: vCPU-based limits apply to running On-Demand instances and Spot instances

- View Limits on EC2 > Limits > vCPU

- Another view to look at it: Service Quotas > AWS services > EC2 > All Standard

- Compare instance types: EC2 > Instances > Instance Types

--------

- #InsufficientInstanceCapacity: if you get this error, it means AWS does not have enough On-Demand capacity in the particular AZ where the instance is launched.

- Resolution:
  - Wait a few more minutes before requesting again
  - If requesting more than 1 requests, break down the requests. If you need 5 instances, rather than a single request of 5, request one by one.
  - If urgent, submit a request for a different instance type now, which can be resized later
  - Also, can request the EC2 instance in a different AZ

---------

- #InstanceTerminatesImmediately (goes from pending to terminated)

  - You're reached your EBS volume limit
  - An EBS snapshot is corrupt
  - The root EBS volume is encrypted and you do not have permissions to access the KMS key for decryption
  - The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part (an image.part.xx file)
  - To find the exact reason, check out the EC2 console on AWS - instances Description tab, note the reason next to the State transition reason label
