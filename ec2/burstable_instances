Burstable Instances (T2/T3)

- AWS has the concept of burstable instances (T2/T3 machines)
- Burst means that overall, the instance has OK CPU performance
- When the machine needs to process something unexpected (a spike in load for example), it can burst and CPU can be VERY good.
- If the machine bursts, it utilizes "busrt credits"
- If all the credits are gone, the CPU becomes BAD
- If the machine stops bursting, credits are accumulated over time
- Burstable instances can be amazing to handle unexpected traffic and getting the insurance that it will be handled correctly
- If your instance consistently runs low on credit, you need to move to a different kind of non-burstable instance

- Waht happens when credits are exhausted?
  - Run a CPU stress command (to peak at 100%)
  - After the credits are exhausted, the measured CPU utilization drops

T2/T3 Unlimited
  - It is possible to hav an "unlimited burst credit balance"
  - You pay extra money if you go over your credit balance, but you don't lose in performance
  - If average CPU usage over a 24-hour period exceeds the baseline, the instance is billed for additional usage per vCPU/hour
  - Be careful, costs could go high if you're not monitoring the CPU health of your instances
