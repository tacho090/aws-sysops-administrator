Elastic IPs

- When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it changes its public IP
- If you need to have a fixed public IP, you need an Elastic IP
- An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 you own as long as you don't delete it
- You can attach it to one instance at a time
- You can remap it across instances
-  You don't pay for the Elastic IP if it's attached to a server
- You pay for the Elastic IP if it's not attached to a server
- With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account
- You can only have 5 Elastic Ip in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that)
- How you can avoid using an Elastic IP
  - Always think if other alternatives are available to you
  - You could use a random public IP and register a DNS name for it
  - Or use a Load Balancer with a static hostname:
