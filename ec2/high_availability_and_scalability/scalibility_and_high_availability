Scalability and High Availability

- Scalability means that an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
- There are two kinds of scalability:
	- Vertical scalability
	- Horizontal Scalability(=elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability
 -Vertical Scalability
	- Vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance
	- Example: t2.micro ---> t2.large
	- Common for non distributed systems, such as a database
	- RDS, Elasticache are services that can scale vertically
	- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale(hardware limit)
- Horizontal scalability
	- Means increasing the number of instances/systems for your application
	- Implies distributed systems
	- Very common for web applications/modern applications
	- It's easy to horizontally scale thanks to the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2


- High Availability
	- High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
	- Means running your application/system in at least 2 data centers(==Availability Zones)
	- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
	- The high availability can be passive(for RDS Multi AZ for example)
	- The high availability can be active(for horizontal scaling)

- High Availability & Scalability for EC2
	- Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size(=scale up/down)
		- From t2.nano - 0.5 G of RAM, 1 vCPU
		- To: u-12tbl.metal - 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
	- Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances(= scale out/in)
		- Auto Scaling Group
		- Load Balancer
	- High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
		- Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
		- Load Balancer multi AZ
