Application Load Balancers

- Routing tables to different target groups:
	- Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
	- Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
	- Routing based on Query String, Headers(example.com/users?id=123&oredr=false)
- ALB are a great fit for microservices & container-based application(Dokcer & Amazon ECS)
- hAS A PORT MAPPING FEATURE TO REDIRECT TO A DYNAMIC PORT IN ecs
- In comparison, we;d need multiple Classic Load balancer per application

route /user -----> 						----> HTTP----> Target group for users application
			External Application Load balancer 
route /search ---->						----> HTTP----> Target group for search applciation 


ALB Target Groups

- EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group)
- EC2 tasks(managed by ECS itself) - HTTP
- Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
- IP Addresses - must be private IPs
- ALB can route to multiple target groups
- Health checks are at the target group level

ALB Query Strings/Parameters Routing


Requests -----> External ALB 	----> ?Platform=Mobile ----> Target Grop 1(AWS-EC2 based)
				----> ?Platform=Desktop----> Target Group 2(On premises - private IP routing)

You can obtain the client IP by looking at the X-Forwarded-For header
